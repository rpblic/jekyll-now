- The Main Problem: Semantic Gap(to computer, it's just a gigantic grid(matrix) of numbers)
![Semantic Gap](/public/img/cs231n/lec2.Semantic_Gap.PNG)
- Visual recognition algorithm must be robust with
  - Lighting conditions
  - Location of camera
  - Brightness
  - Deformation
  - Occlusion
  - Background
  - Intraclass variation
  -  Various labels
-  Data-driven approach: Train bunch of data, then predict given test data for pre-knowledge from train data
-  Nearest Neighbor
-  K-Nearest Neighbor
